# ü•î Potato Disease Recognition using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that identifies diseases in potato leaves. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model classifies images into three categories: **Healthy**, **Early Blight**, and **Late Blight**. This system can help farmers and agricultural stakeholders detect potato diseases early, enabling timely and effective treatment.

## üîç Overview

Potato crops are vulnerable to various diseases, especially **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**, which significantly affect crop yield and quality. This project leverages computer vision to automate the detection of these diseases from leaf images.

* **Type**: Image Classification
* **Model**: Custom CNN (built with TensorFlow/Keras)
* **Goal**: Classify potato leaf images into:

  * Healthy
  * Early Blight
  * Late Blight

## üìÇ Dataset

We use the [**Potato Leaf Disease Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) from the PlantVillage repository, hosted on Kaggle. It contains over 2,000 labeled images in the following categories:

* **Healthy**
* **Early Blight**
* **Late Blight**

The images are RGB, captured in various lighting conditions, and are resized to a uniform size during preprocessing.

## üß† Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Architecture Summary:**

* Input: 256x256 RGB image
* Conv2D ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPooling
* Conv2D ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPooling
* Dropout (to prevent overfitting)
* Flatten
* Dense (fully connected layers)
* Output Layer: 3 neurons (Softmax)

Model training and saving logic can be found in `training.py`.

## üöÄ Usage

To **train the model**, run:

```bash
python training.py
```

To **test the model** or run predictions using test images:

```bash
python testing.py
```

## üî¢ Streamlit Interface

This project includes a Streamlit web interface (`app.py`) to interactively test the trained model.

### To launch the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Features:

* Upload a potato leaf image (.jpg, .png)
* Get real-time predictions
* Displays the uploaded image alongside predicted class (Healthy / Early Blight / Late Blight)

Perfect for showcasing the model‚Äôs capabilities in a user-friendly UI.

---

## üìä Results

After training for \~10 epochs, the model achieved:

* **Accuracy**: \~96% on validation set
* **Loss**: Consistently decreasing, with minimal overfitting
* **Confusion Matrix**: High precision/recall across all classes

> *Model evaluation and metrics logging are performed in `testing.py`.*
